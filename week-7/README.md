# Week 7: 11 Oct - 17 Oct

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `lab-7`: the folder to contain lab examples and exercises, non-evaluative component.
- `assignment-5`: the folder to contain the weekly evaluative programming assignments.

The compiled `.class` files will be generated in the `src/bin` folder by default.
