# Week 3: 13 Sep - 19 Sep

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `lab-3`: the folder to contain lab examples and exercises, non-evaluative component.
- `assignment-1`: the folder to contain the weekly evaluative programming assignments.

The compiled `.class` files will be generated in the `src/bin` folder by default.
