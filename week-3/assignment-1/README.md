# OOP Assignment 1
## 1. Static Affairs

**Problem**

You are given a class definition `TestStatic1` in the code template, with a static variable `a`. Two objects of this class, `ts1` and `ts2` have also been instantiated for you in the driver class' `main` method.

You will be provided an input integer  in each testcase. Use this integer to set the value of the static variable `a`. Your task is to print the initial value of `a` (before the mutation) using `ts1` and final value of `a` using `ts2`. Also, make a note of the answer that you get and try to deduce why it should be the expected answer.

**Input Format**

Each testcase contains a single line as input, containing a single integer $n$.

**Constraints**

$0$ ≤ $n$ ≤ $10^6$

**Output Format**

For each testcase, output two lines. The first line should contain the value of `a` and the second line should contain the final value of `a`.

**Sample Input 0**
```
5
```
**Sample Output 0**
```
6
5
```
**Explanation 0**

The value of `a` before the mutation is 6. After setting the value of `a` to input 5, it is printed out.

**Sample Input 1**

```
**Sample Output 1**
```

783

## 2. this has super powers

**Problem**

You are given a `Parent` and `Child` class definition in the code template. Follow the instructions given in the comments of the class methods to get the desired output.

You should intantiate two objects of the `Child` class `c1` and `c2`. For the first object you, should instantiate it using the parameterless constructor and for the second object you should initialize it with the parameterized constructor taking arguments as the input parameters from STDIN.

**Input Format**

Each testcase contains a single line of input, containing 2 integers $x$ and $y$. You should pass the tuple $(x, y)$ as arguments to the parameterized constructor of the `Child` class in the main method.

**Constraints**

$0$ ≤ $x,y$ ≤ $10^5$ 

**Output Format**

For each testcase, output 6 lines of output. For the first 3 lines, the output should be generated by the `print` method of object `c1` and the next 3 lines should be generated by the `print` method of object `c2`.

## 3. Overriding Powers

**Problem**

Pilani has a very famous pizzeria called "Pizzeria" (yes, that's the name!). Since, BITSians frequent this place a lot, Pizzeria has come up with a membership card plan for BITSians.

There are two types of cards: Silver and Gold. Each card can be initiated with some starting credits based on the amount payed while initiating the card (details in the code template).

Buying a pizza from Pizzeria costs some amount of credits on the card registered for the customer. For the Silver card, the card can only be used if the remaining credits in the card are more than or equal to the credits about to be spent on the current transaction. Otherwise an error message is shown.

The gold card however has some benefits (it is only given to students scoring an A grade in the OOP course :D). First, you get to have an additional number of free credits when initiating a Gold card. Moreover, you have an option to top-up the card when the need arises (details in the code template).

**Input Format**

For each testcase, you will be given a card type and the initiation amount $r$ (in Rupees) in the first line. After this, you need to do some operations on the card. The next line contains an integer $n$ , the number of operations on the card.

The next $n$ lines contain the operations on the card.

If the first integer in the line is 1, then call the `print` method on the respective card object to print the details about the card.

If the first integer in the line is 2, then another integer $x$ follows in this line. This indicates that you need to do a transaction involving $x$ credits on the card. Use the `deduct` method on the respective card to achieve this.

**Constraints**

$0$ ≤ $r$ ≤ $10^8$, $0$ ≤ $n$ ≤ $10^3$, $0$ ≤ $x$ ≤ $10^8$   

**Output Format**

The output lines corresponding to each operation should begin on a new line. More details about the output for each operation can be found by looking at the code template and the example test cases.

**Sample Input 0**
```
Silver 1500

**Sample Output 0**

**Sample Output 1**

Credits left in the card: 15

**Sample Input 2**

Gold 5000

2 20

```
**Sample Output 2**
```
Credits left in the card: 25
This card belongs to John Doe
Credits left in the card: 5
This card belongs to John Doe
Credits left in the card: 10
Credits left in the card: 15
Credits left in the card: 20
Credits left in the card: 0
This card belongs to John Doe
```
**Explanation 2**
Initially the user pays Rs. 4000 to get a credit of 15 points. But since this is a Gold card, the user gets 10 additional credits. Then the user does a transaction involving 20 credits. Then again the user attempts a transaction of 20 credits, for which the balance in the card is insufficient. So a top-up is done until the balance in the card becomes sufficient for the transaction. After this, the transaction is completed.

## 4. Pattern Printing

**Problem**
You will be given a positive integer $n$ in the input. You need to print the following pattern corresponding to $n$:

- Print $n$ lines of output, each containing $i$ space-separated integers, where $i$ is the line number.
- The first line contains the single integer 1.
- Each of the next $n-1$ lines contain $i$ space-separated integers starting from $x$ (inclusive), where $x$ is the last integer in the previous line.

**Input Format**

Each testcase contains a single line of input, containing a single integer $n$.

**Constraints**

$0$ ≤ $n$ ≤ $10^3$ 

**Output Format**

Each testcase should contain $n$ lines of output, as described in the problem statement.

**Sample Input 0**
